# Undergraduate Essay: Kernels, Gaussian Processes and Applications
This repository contains my final-year essay (MA395) for my BSc Mathematics and Statistics degree at the University of Warwick, for which I received a mark of 71/100. It provided a theoretical exploration of kernel methods and Gaussian Processes, demonstrating their practical application in the context of non-parametric regression.

### Key Topics Covered:
* **Mathematical Foundations:** A review of essential concepts from functional analysis to formally define kernels;
* **Kernels and RKHS:** A formal treatment of kernels, the "kernel trick", and a detailed construction of the Reproducing Kernel Hilber Space (RKHS) via the Moore-Aronszajn theorem. Properties of common kernels (e.g. Polynomial, Gaussian, Sobolev) are proven and discussed.
* **Gaussian Processes**: A rigorous construciton of Gaussian Processes (GPs) from a measure-theoretic perspective, showing unique characterisation by a mean and covariance function. The essay also covers the link between GPs, their covariance kernels, and the corresponding RKHS.
* **Frequentist vs Bayesian Equivalence**: Demonstrating the theoretical connection between frequentist and bayesian non-parametric models. It proves that the solution for **Kernel Ridge Regression** is equivalent to the posterior mean of **Gaussian Process Regression** under specific conditions.
